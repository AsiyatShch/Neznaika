Intelligent personal assistant for Eksmo publishing house

Project was made for the Non/Fiction international book fair 2023 in Moscow as a part of Eksmo publishing house kid zone.
'Ask Neznaika' is an application designed to answer any questions in a book character way. Its aim is to entertain people of all ages but especially kids. 
All the answers you can get are safe for small children (no politics, drugs, sex etc).

Neznaika is the main character in Nikolay Nosov's famous book series. Therefore, the personal assistant knows most of the stories from those books.

In my person repository I publish a video to illustrate 'Ask Neznaika's functioning as well as some of my work as Data Scientist. It's important to add that all DS materials were prepared in collaboration with my colleague. It is impossible to extract only my part of job.
